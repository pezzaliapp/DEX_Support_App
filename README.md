# DEX Support App — ULW & Lunar Far Side (Prototype)

Educational, offline-ready PWA to support DEX outreach:
- 21‑cm toy simulator (foreground vs global signal).
- Simplified antenna array planner & baseline histogram.
- Conceptual “radio shadow” view for the Lunar far side.

No external libraries. MIT License.

## How to run
Just drop the folder on a static server (or enable GitHub Pages).  
On first load, the PWA installs a service worker for offline use.
